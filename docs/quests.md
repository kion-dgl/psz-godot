# Quest Stories

## Quest 1: Search and Rescue (#18)

**Location:** Valley | **Theme:** Tutorial — Introduction to AI companions and the Sarisa incident.

The guild gets a report that something fell from the sky. Veteran Kai is sent to investigate, and the player tags along. They go through Valley A while Kai teaches the basics and helps fight. After the E transition, they find a crashed dropship with Sarisa unconscious on the ground. As they approach, two hellions attack. After defeating them, Kai says "I'll take her back to town, you go ahead and report to the guild."

**Slimmed-down version:** Kai appears as a static NPC with dialogue at key story points (warp area, transition, crash site) but isn't present as a companion between those points. Combat sections are solo.

## Quest 2: The Paru Pact (#19)

**Location:** Paru | **Theme:** Mag Intro — A "secret" origin for Mags involving the Great Blank.

Researchers have found unusual energy readings in a restricted excavation site in Paru. The player navigates through the ruins, finding lore message packs hinting at Great Blank-era technology. A researcher NPC at the transition warns about the restricted zone ahead. Deeper in, the player discovers ancient tech collectibles scattered through rooms. In the final chamber, they find a dormant Mag prototype — guardians activate when approached. Defeating them recovers the Mag, unlocking/introducing the Mag system.

## Quest 3: Apothecary's Supply (#20)

**Location:** Wetlands | **Theme:** Industry — Establishes how the town produces its own Atomizers.

The town apothecary needs rare ingredients to keep producing Atomizers. The player heads into the wetlands to harvest three types of plants: Sol Leaves (common), Moon Blooms (uncommon), and Star Husks (rare, guarded by enemies). The quest is a gather-and-return — navigate through rooms, find harvestable plants, collect target quantities of each ingredient, and bring them back. Message packs explain how the town's atomizer production works and why it matters for survival.

## Quest 4: Static in the Snow (#21)

**Location:** Snow Fields / Rioh | **Theme:** Survival — A ticking-clock mission that rewards lore-heavy Data Disks.

An expedition team went silent in the snow fields. The player finds their camp and discovers their research terminal still has recoverable data. Interacting with the terminal starts a data download — but it draws in enemies. The player must survive waves of attackers while the download completes. Enemies come from multiple gates and may target the terminal itself. When the download finishes, the player receives Data Disk reward items containing lore about what the expedition discovered.

## Quest 5: Deep Ore Extraction (#22)

**Location:** Valley | **Theme:** Crafting — Introduces the transition from raw materials to forged weaponry.

The weapon smith needs Black Ore to forge new equipment, but ore deposits in the valley have been hoarded by nesting creatures. The player fights through rooms where enemies cluster around ore stashes — defeat the guards to access the ore. Deeper rooms behind key-gates hold rarer deposits. Message packs explain how weapons are forged from raw materials. Collecting enough ore and returning it to the guild introduces the crafting/upgrade system.

## Quest 6: Voices from the Void (#23)

**Location:** Paru | **Theme:** Lore — Archaeology mission involving a "Security Lockdown" event.

Researchers found a sealed Great Blank-era facility in Paru. The player enters to recover ancient message logs stored inside. Each log reveals fragments of history from before the Great Blank. Mid-quest, collecting a specific log triggers a Security Lockdown — all doors seal, alarms blare, and enemies flood in from multiple points. Survive the lockdown to continue deeper. The final log is behind a key-gate. Recovering all logs and returning them to the guild advances the overarching Great Blank mystery.

## Quest 7: The Pure Sample (#24)

**Location:** Valley | **Theme:** Lore — Explains enemy aggression as a biological tragedy rather than just "monsters existing."

Most local wildlife has succumbed to "The Blight" — a corruption that makes creatures aggressive. Researchers need an uninfected specimen for study. The player navigates through the valley fighting blighted enemies while message packs from prior research teams describe how the wildlife used to be peaceful. Deep in the valley, the player finds a pure specimen — a passive, non-hostile creature (e.g., an unblighted rappy). Approaching it triggers waves of blighted enemies drawn to its presence. The player must protect the specimen until the area is clear. Surviving earns a bittersweet victory and a revelation: "The Blight isn't natural."

## Quest 8: The Final Transmission (#25)

**Location:** Makara Ruins | **Theme:** Stakes & Emotional Weight — Even experienced hunters can die.

A frantic young hunter at the guild explains that his mentor, a seasoned veteran, went into the ruins alone to investigate a Great Blank anomaly. He hasn't returned, and his transponder is fading.

The player traces his path through the Makara ruins, finding message packs that tell his story:

- **Message 1 (Entrance):** Confident. *"The ruins are reacting to my photon signature. I'm heading deeper to the central core."*
- **Message 2 (Mid-way):** A room littered with defeated enemies. *"Got careless. The Blight here... it's more concentrated. My leg is useless. Using a Monomate as a temporary tourniquet."*
- **Message 3 (Deep ruins):** Near a locked door. *"The door is locked from the other side. I've sent the data back to the Guild. If anyone finds this... tell the kids I'm sorry. I won't be back for dinner."*

The final chamber has no boss, no combat music — just ambient wind. The veteran is slumped against a terminal. The player recovers his weapon or ID tag and returns it to the young hunter at the guild. No fanfare. Just a quiet "thank you."
